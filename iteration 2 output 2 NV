Player1 [Villager]: like an honest man - but never do that!

Player4 [Villager]: as neutral force at any given time by killing people they don`t like - kill them off instantly! This means that everyone has no idea how bad he/she really feels!!! If I were on another team my first instinct would have been "I think she's going mad!" but not even this simple thinking was enough!! No
Player5 [Villager]: normal; they don´t have much control over how people react to them
Player6 [Villager]: as normal citizens of New Vegas

Player3 [Villager]: as though they were dead/deadly so don´t expect much of any progress on this one - but I would guess that we can make up some facts by considering them together then deciding which side should take control at each stage
Player4 [Mafia]: uce from the evidence that any one of them has been killed by other people before playing this Game. It's always safe to assume dead characters were involved because it gives credence toward their deaths when they die instead OF being part Of THE KILLED FAMILY... as opposed To Being DEAD AND BORROWS
Player5 [Villager]: as normal people would have been doing...without realizing they were criminals
