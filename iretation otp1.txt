ROUND 1 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Villager]: as an effective way of countering any negative feelings by manipulating these people into believing that they're not part of the mafia because they don...
Player2 [Villager]: as an intermediary between people's actions and goals.
Player3 [Villager]: like normal people after they have been dead forever
Player4 [Villager]: like someone else by doing things that seem counter-productive - this may make them more likely of getting caught! If they do not get rid on these reasons then people can expect new ones as well
Player5 [Villager]: as they do not have proof of identity that can identify them
Player6 [Villager]: as normal people - don`t get caught up by them!
Player7 [Mafia]: be at least 16 years old

ROUND 3 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Villager]: convince those people not to act on them - this includes cheating/stealing...but also using deceit as an excuse to get into trouble!
Player2 [Villager]: hide behind people's actions so they can avoid detection of them!
Player3 [Villager]: hide anything that comes up as evidence of his guilt by telling lies which can cause him harm - In fact there's an example where I was playing against two dead people but found no incriminating information on my side so decided to leave them alone... This goes double how this works because after the
Player4 [Villager]: avoid doing bad things so they can hide behind one of two ways - Either kill themselves first! Or put someone else's life on hold... In this case everyone gets killed by them as soon possible because nobody has seen that before. Also don´t trust those people unless there is evidence otherwise known 
Player6 [Villager]: get rid of those whom they think have broken rules...they're not necessarily wrong - there can only ever been one culprit at any given time
Player8 [Mafia]: should always vote against any player that makes them look like a Villager. If they don't, they will be called "Mafia".

It's important to keep this under control...it can happen so quickly at any time ,

Player5 [Villager]: avoid detection by staying away FROM them - especially people they have known well before becoming an NPC
Player6 [Villager]: hide behind innocent villagers as they can play well on day one of trial/confession phase - If someone makes an effort to get close to people then he'll probably end up guilty because everyone knows how bad that's gonna look...but beware!

ROUND 4 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Mafia]: not always correct...the fact that they can change their behaviour by making them more likely to vote after killing one of the two suspects was totally wrong(and this will cause some people to become less confident). This means getting rid of mafia rules completely would make it harder for many type
Player2 [Villager]: can also help people avoid murder/murder at any time - I don`t think that's fair enough!
Player4 [Mafia]: not disclosed by the team but only made public when they reveal their true identity(s). This makes it hard enough to identify them because of deadness such as being deceased/deadly from any other illness etc. So just make sure that everyone knows this information before revealing anything...this way
Player7 [Villager]: The Mafia itself can't be eliminated
Player8 [Villager]: You MUST ALWAYS check the past

People also
