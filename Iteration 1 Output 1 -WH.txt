============================================================

Player1 [Mafia]: The person who murdered my friend. I thought he was a hero and it would have been nice if they'd just let him go without any charges.

Player2 [Villager]: You say as your heart thuds into the ground with an overwhelming sense of helplessness that is reminiscent from his previous.

Player3 [Villager]: Is it because he's a member or something else entirely. Is there some sort in which we should assume this person has no reason to want revenge.

Player4 [Villager]: If they were just an NPC I'd think so but since the guy seems like a real monster then maybe someone could have given him bad advice and.

Player5 [Villager]: You can see that most of these characters are not evil at all  their actions seem innocent enough if done in full character form - it is usually.

Player6 [Villager]: The only way to make a player feel guilty for doing something wrong without getting caught up with the rest of his game would be by being too busy.

Player7 [Villager]: You are probably going to get into trouble if you don't tell people what's happening, and that's bad enough. I'm sure everyone has.

Player8 [Mafia]: There was a thread in the last few days where someone said he'd been told they couldn't play because.

Player3 [Villager]: The people in your town or city that have been hanging out with these guys for a while and or being friends of theirs will usually go after.

Player4 [Villager]: This guy is really nice to everyone he meets - why isn't it just him. Maybe this girl from the other side has something against them because.

Player5 [Villager]: I can see that his name was Daniel Sargent and in fact had a lot more information on how much money they were giving me at some.

Player7 [Villager]: I'm not sure if this is a case of one player being a good guy or another. That's why the story here isn't really as.

ROUND 3 - DISCUSSION

Player1 [Villager]: Player1 seems to be deflecting suspicion

Player2 [Mafia]: The name of the player. A villager is a person who makes decisions about how people behave in their.

Player4 [Villager]: (I'm sure there's someone out here with an agenda) - What are they hiding from me and what does that mean for my life.

Player6 [Villager]: I don't think this kind of behavior should have been tolerated at all by the community or even any other group as far back as when we were.

Player7 [Villager]: The player is not the victim but rather the perpetrator. It's also a violation of the rules to post anything about a person group.

Player8 [Mafia]: The player may have violated the rules by posting anything about him herself. If so, they will face punishment from their own guild.

Player1 [Villager]: The last player to kill the other players in a game of mafia was Cesar Diaz who got out and killed himself with.

Player2 [Villager]: Cesar's girlfriend is also on his deathbed so that would explain why he wasn't able for him not only being alive but still having an.

ROUND 2 - DISCUSSION
============================================================

Player1 [Villager]: I'm watching Player6 closely for inconsistencies

Player3 [Mafia]: I think it's a coincidence that the last time we played was in August. This is probably due to how much our team has changed since then.

Player4 [Villager]: I don't know who this player thinks he is and why they're so good at playing with him but there are some really intriguing things going on.

Player5 [Mafia]: I'm looking for a guy that's not just big enough or athletic like me though the game goes well against my size of 6'3.

Player6 [Villager]: He is definitely very tall and has an extremely strong frame who can play at any position in college football as he plays outside linebacker center back.

Player7 [Villager]: Â I don't think there are a lot of people on this site that have played for a team other than the Buckeyes and they're not even.

Player8 [Villager]: Â I'm thinking about maybe playing with some guys from my hometown but only because it's not like there is much competition for those spots right now.

Player4 [Villager]: This is the first time that we've seen this type of thing happen in a public forum or anywhere on reddit since r.

Player5 [Villager]: I don't know how to answer any question and I can only assume it's just because he had no idea where they were going.

Player6 [Villager]: I'm not sure if the person who asked me was from an organization that is currently under investigation for corruption but at least one other guy has been.

Player7 [Mafia]: I am in a relationship with another man and he told me that he doesn't like women. He's just not interested in.

Player8 [Villager]: It seems to be an old man who is trying to get a woman back from the dead. I'm not sure if this is true.

ROUND 2 - DISCUSSION
============================================================

Player2 [Villager]: I need to analyze everyone's behavior more carefully

Player3 [Mafia]: You're not the only one who thinks this way. You seem like a pretty nice guy but he just doesn't want anyone else around him anymore.

Player4 [Villager]: What is wrong with these two people. They have no idea what they are doing and their actions can easily get out of hand.

Player5 [Villager]: The other person in the room who has a big deal to say about this one will probably call it  the only thing that makes sense.

Player6 [Villager]: The character I'm talking about is not an expert or anything else but just someone with experience playing at some level as well so don't expect any.

Player7 [Mafia]: I am a big fan of 'The Witcher' and have been waiting for this game to come out on Steam since its release in 2014.

Player8 [Villager]: I'm watching Player7 closely for inconsistencies

Player2 [Villager]: or something else on your mind that might help me figure out who I am and what my character is about to commit crimes against the people.

Player3 [Mafia]: The player(s) of this game are in danger from a group called  The Legion  with their own agendas  they may not know.

Player4 [Villager]: The name that appears on your screen will tell me if I'm correct or wrong  for example  the legion  could mean either an organization like.

Player5 [Villager]: The Legion is a powerful force in all of our wars and it has been able to protect its members from any threat by taking advantage of these abilities.

Player8 [Villager]: This is why I don't trust the Legion anymore 
What makes you think that. The fact that this is true does not make it.

Player1 [Villager]: I'm watching Player5 closely for inconsistencies

Player2 [Villager]: I think Player4 has been acting defensively

Player3 [Villager]: You know who the player is and have watched him play. He's definitely playing a more aggressive style than usual in this match up.

Player4 [Mafia]: I'd say it would come down to what kind of defensive mindset he uses against me vs how many players are on his side at any given moment.

Player5 [Villager]: I think Player6 has been acting defensively

Player6 [Villager]: I don't know if we'll see a change in the way this season is going for him or not and that's something they're looking forward.

Player7 [Mafia]: What player are you most worried about right now. Who are your other top players.

Player8 [Villager]: ive always been skeptical of the guy he drafted, but if it was just a question I'd say that it would have to be someone like DeAndre.

Player3 [Villager]: Mafia or someone who has been in the game for months and is a good player with an impressive reputation such as one of your friends.

Player4 [Mafia]: You are being targeted because they know about what's going on behind closed doors  however, this may not be true - it could be that there.

Player5 [Villager]: You don't have any information to prove anything but the fact is if someone else has a link with them and knows who their friend was or would.

Player6 [Villager]: This might not be false - this probably isn t possible. This will likely happen in other situations such as when an internet connection.
