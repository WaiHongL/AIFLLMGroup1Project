ROUND 2 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Villager]: help each other get better at this task - including working on how best to do so
Player2 [Villager]: solve problems quickly
Player4 [Villager]: become more powerful by playing dirty games like "Dumpster diving" , where they think that each vote counts as one thing but also not really true . If someone does something wrong then he/she has no chance of getting away again ! This leads to people's becoming angry because this should have been do

ROUND 3 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Villager]: get rid of anyone else that disagrees with them by not doing anything wrong - they'll do nothing but follow those rules!
Player2 [Villager]: influence people by acting on reasons they don’t understand - I am not an expert at this point but my understanding of how things work was very strong back then
Player4 [Villager]: influence actions that they don 'lose'. If someone does not trust him/her enough then he can kill them instantly
Player5 [Mafia]: identities may not match their names/lives correctly at times; they can still have been involved in this play during some other phase of the same round... so please don´t forget that information when choosing which gamemode to choose from :)
Player6 [Villager]: convince people they're not mafia by changing how things seem
Player8 [Villager]: to hide information, and you will get killed in a matter of minutes

ROUND 4 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Villager]: will always play like an enemy as opposed to someone else
Player2 [Villager]: will never gain more of an advantage at this point
Player4 [Villager]: doesn´t give an answer at first sight - only evidence of actions that lead to punishment!
Player5 [Mafia]: In order not lose credibility by being considered guilty of participating improperly at times, it's best that they don`t call themselves 'Mafia'. They can still appear suspicious though...
Player6 [Villager]: 's will not lie - If there are any hints that they may have been involved in something illegal/illegal activity then investigate further into these matters before making conclusions based on speculation

ROUND 5 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Villager]: - There will never be any "other" characters of someone else's character at this stage.
Player2 [Villager]: - In this case, they will not have any responsibility for making sure that these actions do not go wrong
Player5 [Mafia]: FOR PLAYERS OF THE COUNTED VERSION :
Player6 [Villager]: The key word here is "contradict". There may be several different reasons why someone could accuse another of something they did not do. For example an innocent woman accused her boyfriend's ex of rape because she said he had threatened them before sex... but that doesn�t prove anything! If both par

ROUND 6 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Villager]: communication by everyone else; no matter how bad things go on they will never change at any given moment
Player2 [Villager]: actions!
Player5 [Mafia]: NOTE ABOUT THE COUNT SYSTEM : This system was developed by my friend John Tresco of Dice Magic Games . It's based around using numbers as evidence instead which means that it will take longer to execute each round but should give some clues at the start so everyone can make good guesses without havi
