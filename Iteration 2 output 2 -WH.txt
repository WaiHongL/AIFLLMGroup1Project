Player1 [Villager]: them so that they don´t get involved

Player2 [Villager]: this list!

Player3 [Villager]: possible evidence on page 2 of this article! This means that there will ALWAYS have been more dead people then everyone else here today so make sure you read up before playing again later as we'll need some help figuring things into our next step...

Player4 [Villager]: dead people's actions/intentions

Player5 [Villager]: information on each round's ballot

Player6 [Villager]: information given by dead players that they did not play any part of creating(the original purpose), nor have knowledge of playing "any" round prior - but only because there were no clues left behind during gameplay which could help identify them as such

Player7 [Mafia]: Villager. Do not expect people to know the truth.

Player8 [Mafia]: Villager and not acting like a Villager.

ROUND 2 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Villager]: /Village based on this rule

Player2 [Villager]: because they're playing wrong by mistake

Player3 [Villager]: first by looking at past statements from everyone else on the list of dead characters that were not present last round

Player4 [Villager]: before any mafia can have an opinion on one's character

Player5 [Villager]: based on clues given by dead players during round play

Player7 [Mafia]: a Villager. Remember, you can get a good mob of Villagers by killing them all (not just the Mafia). This means that you need to get some extra Mafia points (usually with the Mafia) to avoid elimination.

Player8 [Mafia]: a villager. And your team might be Mafia.

ROUND 3 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Villager]: that they're involved in actions based on facts rather then by those people playing against them

Player3 [Villager]: why they voted no one was killed... so that's how I can give my opinion on this topic from timetotime. This means there will always have been an individual at risk of getting into trouble because of his/her vote! If someone wants to get involved here don´t tell them but take note not only by talking

Player4 [Villager]: from evidence that there may have been an act of murder committed against them by someone else before they were killed

Player5 [Villager]: which of two characters has "more" points by talking to both people at each round's end

Player7 [Mafia]: on how you're playing. I've seen people get killed because of being played against them, so it's not too hard to assume that you're at least trying to help.

Player8 [Mafia]: on how much of a Mafia player you are. How many Mafia members have you played? How often did you play the game? What's your current level of playing? Do you have any other Mafia games on the list?

Player4 [Villager]: dead people's actions on this list before playing!

Player5 [Villager]: circumstantial evidence such as "Who was standing at home last night?"

Player6 [Mafia]: villagener rather then an impulsive mobster. And it's not just the way people talk! By appearing suspicious instead of acting rationally, each member can help them avoid being blamed by others as well that could result in more deaths at their hands. It may also save some lives though... I have seen

ROUND 3 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Mafia]: the situation at hand. In this case, keep an eye on how many people have been killed by mafia as opposed to just one guy killing everyone! Do not ignore any of these rules when it comes time to make sure that they work together more effectively? I think we need to focus on each other because our own

ROUND 4 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Mafia]: actions should not distract from the fact that no one has been convicted of any crime but they can only explain why other people were wrong! So there's nothing illegal here so it makes sense as well :)

Player2 [Villager]: have never heard of them before.

Player3 [Mafia]: goal should always BE TO UNDERSTAND YOUR INVESTIGATION AND DISCHARGE THE PERSON WHO RECEIVS THEM! I hope this helps everyone understand the rule of silence when it comes up!!!

Player6 [Villager]: don t get an "F" on any of these phases! This will help avoid confusion during elimination round discussions

Player7 [Villager]: No one will know the Mafia's identity
