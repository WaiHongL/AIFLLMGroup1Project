Player2 [Villager]: take advantage of this situation as they do so - that's why I'm going ahead with them!
Player3 [Mafia]: names should not imply their status as dead mafia users...they may have been killed by other mobsters at some point before they became active; however this does not mean that any given member has died of illness alone since death from infection/contamination
Player4 [Villager]: avoid detection by killing non-Mafia characters - no matter how bad they may have been during previous games
Player5 [Villager]: manipulate perception of how "good" they really feel - only trust them on points that can easily be proven wrong by evidence!

ROUND 4 - DISCUSSION PHASE
Player1 [Villager]: needs no money! This is why this rule applies only at Game 6 on Monday night. It will not apply unless there's an ongoing debate between both parties regarding how they should behave as part of our community...
Player2 [Villager]: will never show up at any time during its current phase
Player3 [Mafia]: This campaign was developed by Game Theory Society of New York which provides an interactive version/subscription system that allows users accessible data regarding real life situations as well... this has no impact on gameplay mechanics nor does it mean anything other then keeping things simple :) 
Player4 [Villager]: cannot influence gameplay by acting alone at every turn
Player5 [Villager]: do not always respect eachother's opinions - If they don´t agree with someone´s actions, that doesn`ts mean we can trust them!

So please check yourself first before commenting at any point like I did... It would help avoid sp
