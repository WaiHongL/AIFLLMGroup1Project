Player1 [Villager]: how they're supposed to behave within groups of people on different levels

Player3 [Villager]: something from past statements of guilt by looking at future ones before casting one on an innocent character(s).

Player3 [Villager]: before using "questioning" techniques such as asking people why they voted them down while ignoring accusations of wrongdoing/defamation by someone else(s). These include telling another party that one member was involved but didn´t vote against him at any point during his life because he could not

ROUND 1 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Villager]: dead people/people of unknown circumstances

Player2 [Mafia]: man because of the fact that he's not at work now

Player3 [Villager]: information gathered by another member of the team! This means that any time someone reveals something they will lose some trust which could lead them to get involved more actively against those around him/her. If there's evidence on one side opposing mafia then this can cause problems as well so ke

Player4 [Mafia]: individual rather then being an opponent of the team/Village they belong TO!

Player5 [Villager]: ONLY information that can fit into an elimination round(s). If no clues come up on Day 3 of every phase, then assume they're not going after each other at this stage. Use common sense!

Player6 [Villager]: circumstantial evidence alone

Player7 [Villager]: before any players reveal the identity of the Mafia

Player8 [Villager]: and how they are hiding

ROUND 2 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Villager]: - What's wrong with them?

Player2 [Mafia]: Villain as an individual without the proper understanding of why they should not participate

Player3 [Villager]: first before deciding on which character(s). If there's no mafia leader at hand, everyone else will follow them! This makes sense because every time someone takes over an office from another member of the group, they lose influence/confidence so that nobody has any chance of getting back into power 

Player4 [Mafia]: good guy/woman... but it's the way of life.... not as easy at first!

Player6 [Villager]: before eliminating them!

Player7 [Villager]: trying to deflect suspicion

Player1 [Villager]: .

Player2 [Villager]: - What does that mean?

Player4 [Villager]: BEFORE deciding whether they will vote against each other - In this case I was doing research on how people behave after killing mafia NPCs as well. Here's my analysis of some cases where dead NPC were considered not bad enough by both parties...for example 'I don`t care', so why would everyone give

Player5 [Villager]: from information that was shared at round end

Player6 [Mafia]: good villa owner! Be prepared for negative comments from other people when being called the bad guy because they don´t get it...but also avoid them by doing something logical that makes their eyes glaze over instead of just saying some dumb crap while looking at others' reactions :) ;)

Player7 [Villager]: being defensive

Player8 [Mafia]: a Villager. If your opponent knows that you're Mafia, they'll probably get their Mafia. If you don't, they'll likely be able to get out of the game and kill you. However, there's no way that you could defeat them without killing everyone except one person at once.

Player3 [Villager]: dead people's statements before casting an vote on them

Player4 [Villager]: circumstantial evidence of previous acts such as murder/murdering etc. If there isn"a credible explanation", then this will lead directly to more deaths on account that dead people may have been involved. However many times I've played them before they were too late so no one can predict how long af

Player1 [Mafia]: Villager

Player2 [Villager]: - If they lie on this topic, try not asking them why there's no mafia problem...or whether one of them wants to call another member more serious If someone else thinks that he has too much information then take him down as well.

Player3 [Villager]: before revealing them! This allows more time on board/playtime; make sure that everyone knows which ones they should play first ! Also note this rule does not allow people of any race as long ago . If anyone has played something previously then we will check whether he's still playing now so please 

Player4 [Villager]: first from previous actions on them - so they can become even more suspicious of eachother

Player5 [Villager]: based on evidence only after playing games like this one together!

Player7 [Mafia]: a Villager and doing your best to get the other players involved. Remember that Mafia is not the same as Mafia. And don't underestimate your enemies, it can be dangerous. You may end up getting Mafia.

Player2 [Villager]: can change over time depending on how they feel as of right now. There will be more people going into this stage because these decisions were made by some very bad actors from previous years - not even after any major changes had been taken at that point.

Player4 [Villager]: change from round to round based on each vote / kill by anyone involved. We suggest that everyone play as dead before playing this rule! If someone dies while having no clue why they're doing something then we can investigate them thoroughly - but don´t forget there is nothing wrong at stake here si
