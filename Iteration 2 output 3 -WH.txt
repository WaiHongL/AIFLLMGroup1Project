Player1 [Villager]: that group after playing this round

Player2 [Mafia]: individual; however, the goal of this project has always been to keep everyone safe.

Player3 [Villager]: dead people's actions/behaviors...so that no one knows more!

Player4 [Villager]: previous conversations/players - that's not possible on this phase of playing!

Player5 [Villager]: clues provided by dead players

Player6 [Villager]: evidence alone

Player7 [Mafia]: Mafia member, which means that you can act like a Mafia member without being guilty of the crime. This can be very difficult when the Mafia is under siege and your teammates do not believe you. It also means that you can't just make it up to them by acting as a Mafia member and they'll accuse you of

ROUND 2 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Villager]: - Some people accuse anyone they don t want - this one just means that there's no need for explanation at all.

Player2 [Mafia]: Villain

Player3 [Villager]: by looking at statements of evidence - such as history etc. – but also using direct experience from another group member like family/friends! This will help avoid getting into trouble because everyone gets blamed on one side while someone else loses something important they don´t get back!! If anyon

Player6 [Mafia]: citizen as opposed the angry mobster that has been hunting down everyone since Day One. This isn´t an easy task because there's not much information available at this point which means it takes some time to figure things OUT!

If everyone wants more control over whether people get attacked, then take action quickly so

Player3 [Villager]: dead people's decisions - unless they have knowledge of mafia history . This can lead us into an issue where we need to solve this problem before our next round begins! Use common sense on both sides as well. If some die off while everyone else dies , then that means there will not always exist any 

Player4 [Mafia]: citizen of the world so that other people can follow up their mistakes while we try not get screwed over by our own actions!

Player5 [Villager]: past elimination games; this could mean that they were innocent...but not necessarily guilty of anything!

Player6 [Villager]: clues provided by fellow players
