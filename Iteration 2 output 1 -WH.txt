Player3 [Villager]: evidence gathered by another party member's friends/families(friends of people that have been involved).

Player4 [Mafia]: individual when there's an opportunity at the end of each round; it takes patience & honesty before accepting those arguments as fact. I'm sure that many people have not been able do this successfully so far but my friends don' t want them doing any more work anyway!!

Player5 [Villager]: clues only that were shared by those dead characters

Player6 [Villager]: evidence provided by witnesses/voters

Player7 [Mafia]: Villager and pretending to be one. You should be able to talk to people with similar beliefs. If you are not an expert on Mafia games then do not talk to them. If they are Mafia they need to find someone who is not mafia or else they will be too busy. Be patient because you may get mobbed.

Player4 [Mafia]: actions that should not happen without your knowledge... just as an argument can cause chaos between two people when it's said so by other teammates? Or do they have separate opinions on things such Assemblies of Thieves ? I'm sure there were plenty where this worked perfectly fine but maybe we need

Player3 [Villager]: from evidence that someone will get killed before killing them at any point

Player4 [Villager]: from this that these people may not have done anything wrong

Player6 [Villager]: these things from clues that appear on screen before each round - such as "Who did this?" ("He said she stole my jewelry" etc.)

Player7 [Mafia]: on how many Mafia members you have. If it's less than one, you're dead. If it's more than 100, you're still alive.

Player8 [Mafia]: on your strategy, which means that you have to play the game wisely.

ROUND 4 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Villager]: CANNOT get rid of them by using simple rules like "If I were an honest guy that's going on my own life"

Player3 [Villager]: can only kill dead people once they have been killed by an NPC/Villager (initiated killing). This means that everyone else will also die as well. When there's no further action from one party member on this phase of the process - then he dies too!

Player4 [Villager]: MUST remember that no one knows whom they voted for because there's nothing more obvious at stake here! This means each round has been played on every possible scenario imaginable so far... even though we're not sure which side of this argument will prevail first - those people may have some very st

This means every single participant MUST take action on his/her own behalf against those responsible . To prevent anyone from kn

Player5 [Villager]: will not get credit points by killing someone else - they just "passed" on that round because of an oversight/miscommunication from another participant.
