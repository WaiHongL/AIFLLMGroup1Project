Player3 [Mafia]: part of the community!

Player4 [Villager]: dead people's statements on how they behave/say things...if this doesn`t work - so don´ts expect any of these rules change anytime soon!

Player5 [Villager]: each round's results ONLY!

Player6 [Villager]: information given by each of the remaining people present during round 4

Player7 [Mafia]: Villager. Don't be too quiet. Be tactful. Don't be aggressive. Don't be rude to the other Mafia members. Don't tell them they have to act like a Villager. Don't tell them you don't think they can handle Mafia. Don't tell them you don't want them to kill each other. Don't tell them they need to fight

Player3 [Mafia]: bad guy...

Player4 [Villager]: by talking at least once before doing so

Player5 [Villager]: by looking at clues found on cards that can reveal his/her identity(s). If there is no clue left... NO! It's not really necessary because only one of two people will get killed - either he/she dies before finding any information OR someone else gets them while they're still active ;)

Player6 [Villager]: by observing them during elimination games. They will give no clues except that they're not playing well!

Player5 [Villager]: which of three people was accused first by observing how they responded while still talking!

Player7 [Mafia]: on you doing well. However, you do need to make sure that the mafia are eliminated before you can succeed in your elimination phase. You may also want to consider switching between players.

In case somethi

Player4 [Villager]: that some dead/deadly mobster was killed by another member of the same team as yourself before killing them

Player5 [Mafia]: each of these strategies! Stay calm when accusing people because it's important that they don`t think something bad happened; however, do not let them get away with their guilt by making sure everyone knows this information beforehand. Remember also that there may come a time during the discussion p

ROUND 1 - DISCUSSION PHASE
======================================================================

Player1 [Mafia]: individual but not going overboard by showing that he's an innocent man

Player2 [Villager]: whom they play

Player3 [Villager]: dead characters only! There is no way of knowing why someone died before they were resurrected!! This will prevent an infinite loop where everyone dies anyway...but that's not really necessary at this point because people get killed too quickly by zombies but also some don´t die instantly after kill

Player4 [Villager]: previous actions that have been made by dead people before they play against each another

Player5 [Villager]: each round! It doesn´t matter how much evidence they have against them...they will always lose so that's why there is no need of sharing any information between sessions - Only trust where one can easily see someone playing bad/good as opposed an evil mastermind behind every move..just look at these

Player6 [Villager]: evidence given by fellow survivors!

Player7 [Mafia]: Villager.

Player8 [Villager]: - How many players play Mafia

If anyone has an issue let me hear

======================================================================

Player1 [Mafia]: the situation at hand. I think it's time to stop talking so that everyone can understand how their actions lead to some sort of real change when they start feeling bad again. We need to create an environment where we don't just sit around saying things such as this without really knowing which peopl

Player2 [Villager]: HAVE NO RIGHT TO RECEIVED THIS DOG OR ANYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM!

Player4 [Villager]: MUST keep track of every member's position on an individual basis after round 6! This means that any time someone says something bad they will have been punished by not knowing how much he has done wrong; but this doesn´t mean there was no cheating from previous kills either. Also note that these ru

Player5 [Villager]: may not vote on each round individually - they will only ever be voted upon by everyone else at any given time. This prevents potential surprises from happening... but that's ok because every single one of those dead players could have been killed anyway!

Player1 [Villager]: - they will always have enemies like me!

Player2 [Villager]: /Village from this phase of play

Player3 [Villager]: first before answering them directly! This will ensure that no one else can come up with something stupid like this again at any point during the match. If there's an easy way to get rid of mafia from people too late then why not start by telling everyone how they knew so much more now instead?!

Player5 [Mafia]: normal villageman at the table while making sure that no one believes anything but yourself!

Player6 [Villager]: based on how they have played/played during previous round's play

Player7 [Mafia]: a Mafia member.

Player8 [Villager]: lying to you - do not tell anyone

Player1 [Mafia]: member of the group which has been killed by an individual . This means that when we decide to make excuses, people may feel uneasy while they think it's necessary to talk openly regarding them as well. I am not sure how this works but my main problem here was finding common ground between those two

Player2 [Villager]: them by playing as they want to see/remember how these people will react - They MUST KNOW WHY THEY WILL FELTER!

Player3 [Villager]: dead people's statements...but not everyone knows! This can lead some of them into thinking they may have been killed by someone else as well

Player4 [Villager]: dead people's actions/punching decisions

Player5 [Mafia]: citizen while remaining calm under pressure.

Player6 [Villager]: circumstantial evidence alone

Player7 [Villager]: by reading what other players have said and analyzing them

Player5 [Mafia]: how long it takes the other people of the group to convince eachother that they need help from an unseen force which has taken over their lives.
