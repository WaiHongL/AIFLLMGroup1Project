Player2 [Villager]: where they came from on each round by looking at how many of them were involved

Player3 [Mafia]: the number of people around you that don' care much at first... but eventually they'll move into something other than their usual suspects!

Player4 [Villager]: how many dead people were killed by an individual before they can talk them into eliminating him/herself. This may not take long! I suggest that everyone play this asap but please make sure anyone involved knows exactly where one of these deaths was committed!!!

Player5 [Mafia]: keeping up the pretense of being one of the two remaining survivors! And since everyone's playing this together as an organized group, it doesn´t take much effort by any of us but we'll have fun while doing so.

Player7 [Villager]: uce from clues that one person is doing something wrong

Player3 [Villager]: evidence gathered by dead people during elimination phase. If everyone knows one thing but doesn 'know', then they should not play again at this stage of the tournament!

Player4 [Mafia]: individual rather then acting suspiciously at the expense of others when needed

Player5 [Villager]: clues that have already been given by some people during round 2

Player6 [Villager]: information shared by deceased teammates

Player7 [Mafia]: Villager. When asked who may be Mafia, you can respond by asking: "Who did you kill last night?"

Player4 [Mafia]: good guy/bad guy at the same time. It's not easy when everyone seems nice but no one can tell them apart from each other! As long as they don 'trust' others that way, it doesn´t matter how many times we lose an argument...it`s okay because people have their opinions....just make sure everybody agree

Player5 [Villager]: by analyzing data collected during round 3 . Use this information as well as any clues discovered from prior games that may help identify suspects quickly.

Player6 [Villager]: by analyzing evidence such as clothing/car keys on victims - see how many of each item were taken from those bodies!

Player7 [Mafia]: a Villager or not, as the mob may get caught

Player2 [Mafia]: Villard! Once the accusation has been proven that you don't have any evidence of mafia involvement, try not to make it sound as though something was going wrong when everyone came forward saying this... but then get yourself over there :)

Player3 [Villager]: before deciding on an action that will lead them into retaliation - i don´t expect this rule change anytime soon!

Player4 [Villager]: first before revealing information from dead ones

Player5 [Villager]: from clues presented during round 4

Player6 [Villager]: before talking

Player7 [Villager]: guilty of any crime by analyzing what players say
