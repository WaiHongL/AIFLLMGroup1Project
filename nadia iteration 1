Player2 [Villager]: 3 seconds ago 2nd sentence - 1st time in 10 years to kill someone.

Player3 [Villager]: They may have been watching us for some time now as we are talking about this situation on our own phone with one another at night when I am.

Player4 [Villager]: I'm a friend of his who's brother was killed by him last year and he tried killing me because i told him not like that but then.

Player5 [Mafia]: I have no idea what the hell happened to my father or anything else in this world what did it happen to her son her family.

Player6 [Villager]: Player6 seems to be deflecting suspicion

Player7 [Villager]: The only people who know how to kill a man are those who understand him better than anyone else. - Carl Sagan If there was.

Player8 [Villager]: If one thing can have any value for mankind, it is that the world itself will be destroyed by evil  but evil may not destroy.

Player1 [Mafia]: The Evil One. I've got the same question as everyone else in my group who has done this before but can't remember what it was like.

Player2 [Villager]: The following is a list of mafia names that have been eliminated by me from.

Player3 [Villager]: Honey Bee     - Killed off one member with his own gun and then killed another members when he refused to give up on him.

Player4 [Villager]: Duke Eriksen , Big Joe Blackberry   John  The Bull  Miller. The guy who shot the cops in an alleyway was.

Player5 [Mafia]: Duke ejored with a couple of guys that were shooting at them - they're not just white people but are also black men too.

Player6 [Villager]: I'm guessing he's going to shoot some ass. I guess we've got enough time for him and his friends off this street without any trouble.

Player7 [Villager]: Black people in the US were twice as likely as whites to commit murders during the 1950s than they were during the 1970s. The same data.

Player4 [Villager]: I am not sure who it is yet though because some people have told me to trust their words without asking any questions about what happened before this time.

Player5 [Mafia]: I need to think more.

Player6 [Villager]: - A little bit of information was given by the player and a few other players from around the world in regards to these events  they were playing.

Player1 [Villager]: I need to analyze everyone's behavior more carefully

Player2 [Mafia]: - Bitter and angry. He is not really a bad person at all but he has been trying to kill me for several years now so.

Player3 [Villager]: player 1 or player 2 who was involved in the murder of your girlfriend girlfriend friend(s). Player 1 does not seem very interested in telling.

Player4 [Villager]: player 3 from what I understand but i can't really say anything else because it would just make this a more complicated game if we are talking about.

Player5 [Villager]: This is the first time that someone has been killed by an enemy and then one of them dies before they leave their house or go to work with.

Player6 [Villager]: You can see how this might sound in games like The Witcher 3 - but I'll explain it later on at another point  ).

Player7 [Mafia]: I have a question for you guys. If someone wanted to die, would you want them to die.

I've never seen anything that.

Player3 [Villager]: Player 1   He's the head of one mafia family player2    The leader  i. , someone with influence over other people.

Player4 [Villager]: He seems to know all about me. I saw a video on Youtube that shows his face for some reason.

Player5 [Villager]: He was an old guy who played poker in the late 80s and early 90's but never really got into gambling or money until he became addicted.

Player7 [Mafia]: Â I would say they are probably just random people who have been playing a lot of video games since they were kids. They seem to be pretty normal.

Player8 [Villager]: Â There's plenty more out there with different experiences, but the one that gets most attention is the one from  The Elder Scrolls V.

Player1 [Villager]: These are the two players who have been most recently removed from your team for a bad decision they made and.

Player2 [Mafia]: Who did it wrong. Why is this so important to us as our teams get better every day.

Player3 [Villager]: You've got some pretty poor communication skills when talking about things like that in front of me but I'm going with either someone else or myself because.

Player4 [Villager]: I think it's a good guess as to who the culprit is and what their motivation might have been for doing this. It seems obvious enough from.

Player5 [Villager]: The only one that has any kind of evidence in terms which could prove anything about why they did something wrong at all was Kevin De Bruyne -.

Player7 [Mafia]: I don't think it's a case of 'I'm sorry' or 'what can we do to change the world'.

Player3 [Villager]: You know we have a problem here because of the actions taken by Mr C as well - if I can't trust him then how will anyone else.

Player4 [Mafia]: I don t want to think about what would happen next but let's just say that he is an evil man who doesn T care for.

Player5 [Villager]: The best place in the world of CSN was when we were at last one event and they gave us a bunch more information than it took on.

Player6 [Villager]: I know what happened to everyone here but this guy has been around since before his death - so much better.

Player7 [Villager]: I'd like to see him play for the USMNT instead of being part of our team. He's not the best player in.

ROUND 1 - DISCUSSION
============================================================

Player1 [Villager]: I think Player2 has been acting defensively

Player2 [Villager]: Hulk Hogan or Hulkster. If he's a member of the mafia then it makes sense to eliminate him for that reason alone as well because.

Player3 [Villager]: Crazy Joe Rogan is probably going after someone else on his own terms so we can't say who exactly will get eliminated but maybe they'll.

Player4 [Mafia]: I'm not sure how I feel about this particular scenario and the possibility of a repeat offender doesn t seem to have been ruled out by anyone.

Player5 [Mafia]: I think Player8 has been acting defensively

Player6 [Villager]: I don't know if they're in fact playing well but it's hard for me to say  No  at all - just like with other.

Player7 [Villager]: I'm sure that most of the people on this forum are good people and can make a difference in the situation, so maybe I should be more careful.

Player8 [Villager]: My best guess is that there's some sort of anti-social element going on here, but the fact that it seems to have a lot of people.

ROUND 2 - DISCUSSION
============================================================

Player2 [Villager]: A man named Victor  Victor  Bourgeois was a criminal who had been involved in the murder of an innocent woman and then later.

Player3 [Villager]: Victor   The player that killed this victim while wearing his mask  he's clearly not from Montreal or any other part where there are many people.

Player4 [Mafia]: I'm sure they're all out to get me because I've been in the game for a long time now so it would seem logical if someone.

Player5 [Mafia]: I don't know what's going on with that character but my guess is he has some sort of mental illness and probably will have something similar happening.

Player6 [Villager]: I think the first person who comes out in this situation was a male or female guy like him from his own background because there are people around here.

Player7 [Villager]: I'm going to get my ass kicked for being a dude and using the term 'gay' as an insult.

Player8 [Villager]: Male or Female Guy    Gay or bisexual person    Person who is gay or bi    Someone with a disability

Player4 [Mafia]: 1   Mafia 2 Players in Teams     Group A 3 players 4 teams 5 groups 6 games 7 times 8 wins 9 losses 10 total.

Player5 [Mafia]: This is a very interesting case as we can see that it's not just some random person with an old friend or family member  rather more than.

Player6 [Villager]: In this instance the player was named in order to help someone else find out who they are and why he she had been there for so long.

Player7 [Villager]: I am a teacher who has worked as an adult on child abuse prevention programs. I have also taught at least one day care program that.

Player8 [Villager]: I'm not sure if it's the same person who killed my son. You're probably right.
